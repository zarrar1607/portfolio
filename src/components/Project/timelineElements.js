        Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of end-to-end deep learning for robotic navigation, where the control signals are directly derived
        from raw sensory data. However, the majority of existing end-to-end navigation solutions are predominantly camera-based. In this paper, we introduce TinyLidarNet,
        a lightweight 2D LiDAR-based end-to-end deep learning model for autonomous racing.
        An F1TENTH vehicle using TinyLidarNet won 3rd place in the <a href="https://cps2023-race.f1tenth.org/" target="/blank"> 12th F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix competition</a>, demonstrating its competitive performance. We systematically
        analyze its performance on untrained tracks and computing requirements for real-time processing. We find that TinyLidarNet's 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
        architecture significantly outperforms widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based architecture.
        In addition, we show that it can be processed in real-time on low-end micro-controller units (MCUs).

        This project presents a basic job search engine developed using fundamental principles of information retrieval.
        Job search engine aims to provide job seekers with an efficient and straight-forward platform to discover relevant job
        listings based on their preferences and qualifications (on KU CAMPUS). This search engine is a keyword-based Search which
        enables users to enter keywords related to job titles, type of job, salary, or specific skills.
        <br />
        The engine performs a basic keyword matching algorithm to retrieve job postings that contain the relevant keywords,
        helping job seekers quickly identify potential opportunities. The engine displays key information relevant to the
        keyword job postings and provides direct URL's/links to the original job postings, redirecting users to the respective job
        portals or company websites for further details and application submissions.

        In a team of 6, created a prototype for a completely autonomous industrial robotic arm with a combination
        of inverse kinematics program and computer vision to pick objects.
        Developed a computer vision using CNN with the aid of the TensorFlow API for the arm, so that it could identify
        and locate known objects within a workspace. Notably, we implemented a critical component - mapping the physical world to image coordinates.
        This feature enabled the robotic arm to recognize and precisely locate objects within its workspace, paving the way for intelligent and context-aware interactions.
